# NeuralNetwork
Custom Neural Network Implementation with Back-prop

Contains both JBLAS (Matrix library- rd.neuron.neuron package) and simple Array (rd.neuron.deep.* package) based RBM implementations.
Test using MNIST and NotMNIST data sets.

The Deep Learning examples are work in progress. 
This includes:
StochasticNetwork.class
RecipeBuilder infrastructure

The development is loosely following my blog posts on Deep Learning on: fisheyeview.fisheyefocus.com
